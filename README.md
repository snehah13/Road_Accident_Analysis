# 🚗 Road Accidents Analysis - Power BI Dashboard  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Road accidents are a major cause of fatalities and injuries worldwide. Analyzing accident trends can help authorities implement safety measures, improve infrastructure, and reduce risks. This project aims to analyze road accident data to uncover patterns, high-risk areas, and contributing factors.  

## 📊 Project Description  
This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that visualizes road accident trends, including:  
- 📍 **Accident hotspots** based on location data  
- 📅 **Accident trends** over time (yearly, monthly, weekly insights)  
- 🚗 **Vehicle types & accident severity** analysis  
- 🌍 **Weather conditions & impact on accidents**  
- ⏰ **Peak accident hours** to determine high-risk timeframes  

Using **Power BI**, I have cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to derive meaningful insights that could help improve road safety policies.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Power BI** – For data visualization and interactive dashboards  
- **Excel/CSV** – Used as a data source    

## 💻 Hardware & Software Requirements  
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later / macOS (with Power BI alternatives)  
- **RAM:** Minimum 8GB (Recommended: 16GB for large datasets)  
- **Software:**  
  - Power BI Desktop (Latest version)  
  - Microsoft Excel (For data preprocessing)
